    "### Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a popular programming language. It is used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- web development (server-side),\n",
    "- software development,\n",
    "- mathematics,\n",
    "- system scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "What can Python do?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python can be used on a server to create web applications.\n",
    "- Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.\n",
    "- Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.\n",
    "- Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.\n",
    "- Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
    "- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
    "- Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
    "- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means - that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
    "- Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Good to know\n",
    "\n",
    "- The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this Hackathon. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.\n",
    "- In the Hackathon Format Python will be written in a Jupyter Notebook. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Syntax compared to other programming languages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.\n",
    "- Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n",
    "- Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "`   column2 datatype,`<br>\n",
    "`   column3 datatype`<br>\n",
    "`);`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Often you will find columns like 'id' as identifiers for each rows as an index (also called PRIMARY KEY of the table)\n",
    "- A column with the time and date of the creation of the row helps set to set the temporal context (date and time can be stored in one column 'datetime' or in seperate columns 'date' and 'time'\n",
    "- IMPORTANT: after each column needs to be a comma! \n",

It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python. It’s capable of doing everything you’d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s more, the Raspberry Pi  has the ability to interact with the outside world, and has been used in a wide array of digital maker projects, from music machines and parent detectors to weather stations and tweeting birdhouses with infra-red cameras. We want to see the Raspberry Pi being used by kids all over the world to learn to program and understand how computers work. Your Raspberry Pi needs an operating system to work. This is it. Raspberry Pi OS is based on linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basics about linux\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux is a family of free and open-source operating systems based on the Linux kernel. Operating systems based on Linux are known as Linux distributions or distros. Examples include Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Gentoo, Arch Linux, and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Linux kernel has been under active development since 1991, and has proven to be extremely versatile and adaptable. You can find computers that run Linux in a wide variety of contexts all over the world, from web servers to cell phones. Today, 90% of all cloud infrastructure and 74% of the world’s smartphones are powered by Linux.\n",

    "- Select your network in the list, and type your password.\n",

    "SSH stands for Secure Shell. It allows you to remotely connect to a server or system from another device using encrypted communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary benefit of SSH is the encryption itself. With less secure remote login protocols, such as FTP, everything is sent in plain text. A hacker can sniff out those communications and log things like usernames and passwords. Since SSH is encrypted, that’s no longer possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to turn on SSH is through the Raspberry Pi graphical configuration app. Just click the Raspberry icon in the top left corner of the screen, then click “Preferences.” Click “Raspberry Pi Configuration.”\n",
